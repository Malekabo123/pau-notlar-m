Kime saldırdı: High-profile verified Twitter accounts
Yöntem: Social Engineering

Olay:
On July 15, 2020,  130 high-profile Twitter accounts were reportedly compromised by outside parties 
to promote a bitcoin scam. Twitter and other media sources confirmed that the perpetrators had gained 
access to Twitter's administrative tools so that they could alter the accounts themselves and post the 
tweets directly. They appeared to have used social engineering to gain access to the tools via Twitter employees. 
Three individuals were arrested by authorities on July 31, 2020, and charged with wire fraud, 
money laundering, identity theft, and unauthorized computer access related to the scam.

The scam tweets asked individuals to send bitcoin currency to a specific cryptocurrency wallet, 
promising the Twitter user that money sent would be doubled and returned as a charitable gesture. 
Within minutes from the initial tweets, more than 320 transactions had already taken place on 
one of the wallet addresses, and bitcoins to a value of more than US$110,000 had been deposited 
in one account before the scam messages were removed by Twitter. In addition, full message 
history data from eight non-verified accounts were also acquired.
